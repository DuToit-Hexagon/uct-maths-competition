This document gives the steps required to update the live version of the UCT Maths Competition project.

1. Before pulling changes from master, make sure to run the migrations again, so that Postgres is aware
of the current state of the database before the incoming changes.
`python manage.py makemigrations`
`python manage.py migrate`

2. All changes make will have been merged into the master branch of the source repo.
`git pull upstream master`

3. Since the database might not have been set up properly at the time of the previous, partial update,
run the script in uctMaths/scripts/add_new_columns_022021.sql
This was done in testing with
`psql -U postgres uctmaths < add_new_columns_022021.sql`
where "postgres" should be replaced with the appropriate user, and "uctmaths" with the name of the live database.

4. Now run the migrations again so that Postgres can take into account the incoming changes.
`python manage.py makemigrations`
`python manage.py migrate`

5. The project should hopefully be ready to run now. The following two processes must be run simultaneously:
`python manage.py runserver`
`python manage.py process_tasks`
