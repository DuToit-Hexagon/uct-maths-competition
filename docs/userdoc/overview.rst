Interacting with the website
-------------------------------
There are two "modes" of operation for the website, each with a different interface. The "teacher interface", where teachers will submit their entries and the "administrator interface" where the entries made for each school can be managed. As an administrator, you will have access to both.

Teachers who wish to sign up students for a school will be directed to the main website at *uctmaths.sjsoft.com*. The use of this interface is covered in the next chapter. As an administrator, you will be able to access the entries made by teachers. To get to the admin interface go to *uctmaths.sjsoft.com/admin*.
